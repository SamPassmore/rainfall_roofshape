# Objectives --------------------------------------------------------------

# 1. Play with the new D-PLACE database 

# 2. Test a hunch about the relation of roof shape to rainfall (briefly, lots of
# rain negatively selects against flat roofs). Somewhat trivial, but easy to 
# check, lots of data, and fieldwork experience in Ghana provides relevant 
# ethnographic and historical background (including a possible account for an
# apparent exception).

# 3. Do this while controlling for language family and distance


# Preliminaries -----------------------------------------------------------

# Clear workspace

# check for /in/ and /out/ directories (create them if needed)

# "Research that uses data from D-PLACE should cite both the original source(s)

# Hunter-Gatherer dataset: ""Binford (2001);  Binford and Johnson (2006); Kirby
# et al. 2016)."" The reference list should include the date data were

# Hypothesis -----------------------------------------------------------

# Main hunch: Roof type is related to precipitation such that round/sloping 
# roofs more likely when there is much rain. Note the directionality: we expect 
# few flat roofs in high rainfall societies, but we have no predictions for what
# happens in low rainfall societies. In causal terms, high rainfall selects 
# *against* flat roofs, but low rainfall does not select *for* them.

# Linear modelling --------------------------------------------------------------


# A simple linear model doesn't explain a lot of variation (R² 0.05) but comes 
# out as highly significant: if rain would not have any effect on roof type, the
# probability of this data is very low (F(1,1126)=59.5, p < 0.000001).

model1 <- lm(flatroof ~ rainfall, d.lm)
summary(model1)
hist(residuals(model1))
qqnorm(residuals(model1))

# But not all observations are independent: we want to control for language 
# family, so we add that as a random intercept (meaning we allow the value of 
# roof to be 'dependent' to some degree on language family). We compare a model 
# with just language family with one where we also add rainfall as a fixed
# effect. The latter explains the spread of data significantly better (χ2(1) =
# 45.91, p < 0.00001, log likelihood difference 22.95).

model2 <- lmer(flatroof ~ (1|Language.family), data=d.lm)

summary(model3)

comparison <- anova(model2, model3)
comparison[1,4]-comparison[2,4] # log likelihood difference

# But the maps show that some of the flat roofs appear in 'clumps'. Perhaps 
# horizontal diffusion due to cultural contact can explain part of it. We need 
# to take into account distance to nearest neighbour. To do this we use the sp
# and rgeos packages (https://is.gd/FFLbKH).

# We create a spatial object
d.s <- d.no

d.no$distance <- min.dist # add distances to df

d.lm <- d.no # update the copy of the data used for linear modelling
d.lm$flatroof <- as.integer(d.lm$flatroof)

# We create a model where we try to predict flat roof by rainfall and distance. 
# We keep language family as a random effect. Essentially, we check whether 
# rainfall is still important when we control for historical contingency 
# (language family as a random effect) as well as direct social diffusion 
# (distance as a fixed effect). Turns out distance doesn't have a very big
# effect (t value 2.25, model estimate shows it's two orders of magnitude
# smaller than rainfall).
model4 <- lmer(flatroof ~ rainfall + distance + (1|Language.family),data=d.lm)
summary(model4)

# Comparing model3 to model4, the latter may explain the spread of data
# slightly better (χ²(1) = 5.086, p = 0.02412, log likelihood difference
# 2.54), but only if we use a loose criterion of p < 0.05

comparison <- anova(model3, model4)
comparison[1,4]-comparison[2,4] # log likelihood difference

# Conclusion: in this dataset, rainfall is the best predictor of roof shape, at 
# least in the sense that flat roofs are unlikely to occur in locales with a lot
# of precipitation.
